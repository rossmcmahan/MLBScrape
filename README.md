Want to write a project that will look at last series of games to
determine if the NRFI or YRFI is a better bet.

<br/>
Look at trend lines of runs in first inning.<br/>
Does the derivative make sense to look at in these cases?
<br/>
<br/>
Could change the approach to look at statcast dataframe. All home and away
teams are listed in statcast.
